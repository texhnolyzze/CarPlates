# CarPlate
Test task for the company Ai-Novus. It is flexible in the sense that you can determine the number of digits, letters in the car plate. You can also specify an arbitrary alphabet from which the license plate is formed (However, it's order will be based on Unicode order).

To run the application, clone this repository into any folder, ```cd``` to it and in the command line execute ```mvn install```. A working .jar file appears in the ```target``` folder. Run it and you can go to two URLs: ```localhost:8080/number/random``` and ```localhost:8080/number/next```.
